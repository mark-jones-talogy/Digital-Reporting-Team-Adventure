Defintely not perfect but I think it's good enough to meet the requirments. I'd be interested in code reviews on it and see if they match my thinking.

I developed it using TDD and these were the steps I took to create the app.

Should show me what is currently going on
Shows welcome text
Get’s the start state
Get the start options
Allow the user to select an option
Change the state based on the option selected
Display the new state and options
Have the current state stored somewhere
Have it know when it has reached an end state
Have it display valid options
Have it remove Options  that have already been taken
Have option selection map to state
Have it keep going through different states
It tracks if you have done the important tasks
For state 7 it knows if you have done important tasks and doesn’t show annoyed message
Don’t allow revisiting visited states
Check if developer hasn’t been as helpful as they could be
