# Create a Digital Reporting Team Adventure Game

Can you create a Text based Adventure fro mthe following spec?

Or maybe do a code review of my attempt in the branch [marks_solution](https://github.com/mark-jones-talogy/Digital-Reporting-Team-Adventure/tree/marks_solution)

Or just play Marks game and see if you can break it.

## The Vague Spec

Create a team text based adventure, the aim is to try and get some work done. There should be a welcome message and it starts with the first state and options. Then it shows the relevant state and options until the game ends. If the play doesn’t do everything right they should get a message that they have had an okay day. If they make a major mistake they should see the appropriate message. Feel free to make the options clearer.

Welcome message

You spend a pleasant few hours on PluralSight learning something new which will help the team. You decide to do a microlearning on it when it is your turn next. What do you do next?
- Make a cup of tea ready for the refinement to start
- Read all the new messages you have, the team seem quite annoyed

#### 5
There are no tickets that need your attention on the board. What do you do?

- Read Tyler’s message
- Ask Brod for a ticket
- Start a PluralSight Course

#### 6
Everyone is asking what you are up to and if you have had a chance to look at Sen’s and Tyler’s messages? You have annoyed the team. Mark pulls the smell face at you. Life is never the same again.
The refinement is really good. But the ticket still has vague acceptance criteria on it. What do you do?
- Just go with it, you can work out what it is supposed to do later.
- Ask that the acceptance criteria be improved.

#### 7
You get stuck in development hell on the ticket and question is it even worth living anymore? You get so upset you quit your job and become a goat herder in the Andes. You are known as Smelly Goat <Name> for the rest of your life.

#### 8
The team agree and clarify the acceptance criteria. You start work on the ticket and it is dreamy allowing you to get stuck into the problem rather than trying to second guess what the ticket is really about. The team becomes much more successful and you get a promotion. Life feels good and you wonder how you could have ever worked any other way. Congratulations, you have successfully completed The Digital Reporting Team Adventure! 

#### 9
You’ve had an okay day but you could still be a better developer.
